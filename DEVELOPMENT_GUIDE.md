## 📋 Ready for Backend Integration

### What Backend Team Needs to Implement

1. **File System Operations**
   ```typescript
   // Already scaffolded in fileService.ts
   pickFilesFromGallery(): Promise<FileItem[]>
   pickFilesFromDocuments(): Promise<FileItem[]>
   scanDocumentWithCamera(): Promise<FileItem>
   ```

2. **OCR and Text Extraction**
   ```typescript
   // Interfaces ready for implementation
   extractTextFromImage(file: FileItem): Promise<string>
   extractTextFromPDF(file: FileItem): Promise<string>
   ```

3. **AI Integration**
   ```typescript
   // OpenAI integration point ready
   generateFilename(extractedText: string, originalFilename: string): Promise<string>
   ```

4. **File Operations**
   ```typescript
   // File system operations ready
   renameFile(file: FileItem, newName: string): Promise<boolean>
   batchRenameFiles(files: FileItem[]): Promise<FileItem[]>
   ```

### Integration Steps for Backend Team

1. **Install Required Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-google-ml-kit/vision
   npm install react-native-image-picker
   npm install react-native-document-picker
   npm install expo-file-system
   npm install react-native-pdf
   ```

2. **Implement Service Methods**
   - Replace mock implementations in `src/services/fileService.ts`
   - Add actual file system access
   - Integrate OCR libraries
   - Connect OpenAI API

3. **Configure Permissions**
   - Add camera permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - Add photo library permissions in `ios/filesenseAI/Info.plist`
   - Configure file system access permissions

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### State Management
- **React Hooks** for component state
- **Custom hooks** for complex state logic
- **Service layer** for data persistence
- **Context-ready** for global state (if needed)

### Navigation
- **React Navigation 6** with stack navigator
- **Type-safe navigation** with proper TypeScript integration
- **Gesture handling** and animation support
- **Deep linking ready** for future features

### Performance
- **Optimized renders** with proper key props and memoization
- **Lazy loading** ready for large file lists
- **Background processing** architecture for file operations
- **Memory efficient** file handling

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** for service failures
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable feedback
- **Retry mechanisms** for network operations
- **Offline capability** ready (OCR works offline)
